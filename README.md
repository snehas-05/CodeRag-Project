# 🚀 CodeRAG – AI-Powered Repository Chat Assistant

CodeRAG is an advanced **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** based system that helps developers understand, search, and interact with large codebases using natural language.

Instead of manually exploring files and functions, users can simply ask questions like:

- *Where is user authentication implemented?*
- *Explain the login flow.*
- *Which files are responsible for vector search?*
- *How does the API routing work?*

CodeRAG intelligently indexes your repository, retrieves relevant code chunks, and uses LLMs to generate accurate answers with context.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to run a local instance of **CodeRAG** on your machine.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+
- Docker Desktop
- Git

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/snehas-05/CodeRag-Project.git
cd CodeRag-Project
```

### 2️⃣ Start Core Services

Use this only if you want to start the databases/search services by themselves.

If you plan to run the full Docker stack in the next step, you can skip this.

```bash
docker compose up mysql chromadb elasticsearch
```

This starts:

MySQL Database → localhost:3306

ChromaDB Vector Store → localhost:8000

Elasticsearch → localhost:9200

> ⚠️ **Wait for Elasticsearch to be fully healthy before starting the backend.**
> Elasticsearch can take **30–60 seconds** to initialize. You can monitor readiness with:
> ```bash
> curl http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health?wait_for_status=yellow&timeout=60s
> ```

### 2.1️⃣ Docker Compose (Recommended)

Use this flow if you want to run the full stack in Docker:

```bash
# Start full stack
docker compose up -d mysql chromadb elasticsearch backend frontend

# Returning user (fast path: reuse cached layers/dependencies)
docker compose build backend
docker compose up -d backend frontend

# If backend dependencies changed, rebuild backend image
docker compose build --no-cache backend
docker compose up -d backend

# One-time legacy DB fix (safe to rerun)
docker compose exec backend python -m scratch.migrate_user
```

Notes:
- If the migration prints duplicate column errors for `username` or `full_name`, the schema is already updated.
- Prefer `python -m scratch.migrate_user` over `python scratch/migrate_user.py` in Docker so imports resolve correctly.

### 3️⃣ Backend Setup

```bash
# Open a new terminal
cd backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate environment

# Windows
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env and add:
# GEMINI_API_KEY
# MYSQL credentials
# JWT secret

# Start backend server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
Backend URL: http://localhost:8000

Swagger Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

### 4️⃣ Frontend Setup

```bash
# Open another terminal
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start frontend server
npm run dev
```
Frontend URL: http://localhost:5173

### 5️⃣ Ready to Use
Open your browser and start chatting with repositories using CodeRAG 🚀

## 🔑 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the **project root** (or copy `.env.example`):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then configure the following values:

```env
# App Mode ("local" for dev, "docker" for Docker Compose)
APP_ENV=local

# Storage Paths
MODEL_CACHE_DIR=/app/model_cache
REPOS_DIR=/app/repos

# Google Gemini API

```

📌 **Notes**

- Replace all placeholder values with your actual credentials.
- Keep your `.env` file private and never push it to GitHub.
- Make sure Docker services are running before starting the backend.
- Restart the backend server after changing environment variables.
